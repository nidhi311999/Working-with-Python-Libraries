    "* **Precision** - Indicates the proportion of positive identifications (model predicted class 1) which were actually correct. A model which produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Recall** - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.\n",
    "* **F1 score** - A combination of precision and recall. A perfect model achieves an F1 score of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Support** - The number of samples each metric was calculated on.\n",
    "* **Accuracy** - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0.\n",
    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn’t class imbalance into effort, so if you do have class imbalances, pay attention to this metric.\n",
    "* **Weighted avg** - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples).\n",
